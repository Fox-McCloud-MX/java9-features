# Interface Private Methods

---

Using private methods in interfaces have four rules.

1. Private interface method cannot be abstract.
2. Private method can be used only inside interface.
3. Private static method can be used inside other static and non-static interface methods.
4. Private non-static methods cannot be used inside private static methods.
